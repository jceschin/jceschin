### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Juan Ceschin Guntsche. I'm a Full Stack Developer & Industrial Engineer.

After 3 years working in Management Consulting, I decided to learn to code due to my strong interest in the tech industry. I joined Le Wagon coding bootcamp where I built a Web-App that suggests meals to users according to their daily nutrient targets.

Also, I completed Henry's coding bootcamp where I developed an ecommerce app and a virtual wallet using JavaScript, React, React Native, Redux, NodeJS, Express and PostgreSQL, among other technologies.

Looking forward to build great products as a Front-End developer.

My tech stack: JavaScript / React / React Native / Redux / Node / Express / HTML5 / CSS / PostgreSQL / Bootstrap / Ruby on Rails
